  * Not-so-rudimentary-anymore Android image and partition unpacking tool
  *
  * v0.1 - Support unpacking of BootLoader and Boot images, as well as imgdata
  * v0.2 - Supports offset= (for HTC and other boot.imgs where ANDROID! is wrapped)
  *        Supports cmdline= (to override kernel command line)
  *
  * v0.3 - Integrated mkbootimg functionality, added dt_size and id
  *
  * v0.4 - cmdline, addrs..
  *
  * v0.4.1 - Fix for Edvard Holst on Essential PH1 images.. (who uses Essential nowadays, I wonder?)
  * 
  * v0.5 - Update with LZ4 binaries, fix for extract devicetree even if can't uncompress kernel
  *
  * v0.6 - Samsung images (with DT > 0) - Device Tree now found whereever it may hide
  *
  * v0.7 - system.transfer.list support
  *
  * v0.8 - FBPK (SD845 CrossHatch (Pixel 3 XL) bootloader images) AND Huawei Mate
  *        Also compiles cleanly
  *
  * v0.85 - system.transfer.list support for v4 (MTK 64 bit)
  *
  * v1.0  - EFI. Worthy enough a feature that (after three years) I hit version 1 on it, and - JCOLOR
  *
  * v1.1 - Samsung baseband images ("TOC") - 03/04/2020
  *
  * v1.2 - DTBO, super.img (03/20/2020) and integrated Br√∂tli
  *
  * v1.2.1 - Lots of QCOM EFI GUIDs added. Thanks to anonymous contributor!
  *
  * v1.3 - Can now also pack super.img and boot.img based on existing!
  *
  * v1.4 - uBoot uimage format
  *
  * v1.5 - MTK images!
  *
  * v1.5.1 - Fixes: QCOM FPBK fixed (accidentally removed during refactoring around 1.3.. oops)
  *                 UEFI now unpacks files by UI, if presenr, rather than GUID
  *
  * 1.6 - Peek into images to detect payload format, recognize AVB (vbmeta)
  *
  * 1.7 - boot Img header v2,3 and vendor boot images
  *
  * 1.8 - CrAu
  *
  * 1.9 - LZ4/BZ2 integration, selective extraction (extract ..what.. in commandline for some formats)
  *
  * 1.9.1 - Motorola bootloader images (SnL, thanks to NL), some bugfixes
  *
  * 1.10  - FBPK/FBPTv2 (Pixel 6)  
  *
  * 2.0 (beta) - ZIP (including partial zips), XZ, BZ2 and LZ4 now built in 
  *
  * 2.0 (beta1) - Spreadtrum PAC(ket) format, a few bugfixes.
  *
  * 2 - (beta 2) PBZX, AA/YAA
  *
  *  platform-innovation-framework-for-uefi-complete-specifications-v0.90-v0.97 from Intel was invaluable
  *  for figuring out EFI
  *
  * 'extract' now accepts argument (partition name) for super images, as well.
  *
  * This tool is part of the free downloads for the book "Android Internals: A Confectioner's Cookbook"
  * But (as of v1.0) is also quite useful or MacOS T2 firmwares
